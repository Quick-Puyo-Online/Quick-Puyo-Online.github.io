A puyo fangame to quickly set up practice matches within your browser!
This fangame is not affiliated with Sega in any way.

It features basic singleplayer practice in endless mode and basic 1v1 in local.

The plan is to add as many game modes from previous puyo games and to be able to easily play online in them without needing to download anything. The gamemodes Ill be attempting to recreate are based from the nexus wiki: https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Category:Game_Modes

You can play it right here: https://quick-puyo-online.github.io/
